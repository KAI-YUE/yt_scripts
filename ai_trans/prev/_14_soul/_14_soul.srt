1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
Pania named this phenomenon near-death experience, where patients vividly saw their souls floating

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,640
out of their bodies, a bright white light in front of them, and could observe their

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,980
own limbs hovering about 20 centimetres from the ceiling, witnessing doctors busily trying

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,160
to save their bodies through walls and their anxious relatives waiting outside.

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,680
In the future, if I get a chance, I will explain more about on near-death experience to you.

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,440
Pania reasoned, if a patient's soul could float after death, then placing a whiteboard

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,760
on the ceiling with unseen words written on it could test the theory.

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,720
If the soul floated up, it would see the words, assuming these words remain unseen by the

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,520
patient before and after resuscitation.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,320
Pania conducted experiments with over a hundred patients.

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,440
Later, seven resuscitated patients correctly identified the words written on the whiteboard,

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,440
an astonishing outcome.

13
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,520
Pania's report seemed to prove the existence of the soul, yet it could only go so far.

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,160
Scientific experiments require proof, repeatability, and verification.

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:17,120
Decades passed, and aside from Pania, no one else has achieved such critical results, making

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,920
Pania's findings a singular piece of evidence and insufficient to prove the soul's existence.

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,040
We've discussed soul weighing, soul photography, and out-of-body experiences, none of which

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,720
sound particularly compelling or scientifically grounded.

19
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,960
The most compelling explanation for the soul's existence comes from Sir Roger Penrose, a

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,880
Nobel Prize-winning physicist.

21
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,040
Penrose suggests the human brain isn't like traditional computers that rely on bit-by-bit

22
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,480
computation.

23
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,920
It resembles a quantum computer, using qubits to allow both zero and one to be computed

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,820
simultaneously.

25
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,160
He gave a typical example.

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,920
When thinking about what to eat, whether apples, fried chicken, or fries, one doesn't sequentially

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,600
consider fried chicken, then apples and fries, but thinks about them all at once.

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,600
In this state, the qubits are entangled, like SchrÃ¶dinger's cat, which exists in a state

29
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,240
of life and death until observed.

30
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,480
Similarly, when the brain decides what to eat, the wave function collapses, and a decision

31
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,080
is made instantly.

32
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,560
However, Penrose has yet to find traces of quantum computing in brain tissue.

33
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,080
In the 1990s, Stuart Hameroff, the director of the Center for Consciousness Studies at

34
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,200
the University of Arizona, read Penrose's The Emperor's New Mind and realized a magical

35
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,080
structure exists in the human brain.

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,080
Microtubules, filamentous structures that help form the skeleton of neurons and other

37
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,040
cells, may allow electrons to exist simultaneously in the universe and the brain, suggesting

38
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,960
our soul is half in the brain and half somewhere deep in the universe, entangled regardless

39
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,440
of distance.

40
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,800
Penrose and Hameroff called this orchestrated objective reduction theory.

41
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,640
According to their research, quantum is immortal, meaning even after death, the entangled quantum

42
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,960
remains, akin to the traditional notion of ghosts.

43
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,760
Mainstream science harshly criticized the theory upon its introduction, with no one

44
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,760
knowing if microtubule electrons could achieve quantum superposition or equipment to prove

45
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
it.

46
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,160
Moreover, neuroscientists note the cerebellum, filled with neurons and microtubules, doesn't

47
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,080
affect consciousness even when severely damaged.

48
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,200
It's unlikely the soul resides only in the brain and not the cerebellum.

49
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,760
Many believe Penrose's research veered off course, but the Nobel Committee showed more

50
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,720
tolerance and rationality.

51
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Regardless of Penrose's controversial views, his contribution to science cannot be erased.
