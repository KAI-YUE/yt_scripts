Pania named this phenomenon near-death experience, where patients vividly saw their souls floating

00:09.280 --> 00:13.640
out of their bodies, a bright white light in front of them, and could observe their

00:13.640 --> 00:18.980
own limbs hovering about 20 centimetres from the ceiling, witnessing doctors busily trying

00:18.980 --> 00:24.160
to save their bodies through walls and their anxious relatives waiting outside.

00:24.160 --> 00:29.680
In the future, if I get a chance, I will explain more about on near-death experience to you.

00:29.680 --> 00:34.440
Pania reasoned, if a patient's soul could float after death, then placing a whiteboard

00:34.440 --> 00:38.760
on the ceiling with unseen words written on it could test the theory.

00:38.760 --> 00:43.720
If the soul floated up, it would see the words, assuming these words remain unseen by the

00:43.720 --> 00:47.520
patient before and after resuscitation.

00:47.520 --> 00:51.320
Pania conducted experiments with over a hundred patients.

00:51.320 --> 00:57.440
Later, seven resuscitated patients correctly identified the words written on the whiteboard,

00:57.440 --> 00:59.440
an astonishing outcome.

00:59.440 --> 01:06.520
Pania's report seemed to prove the existence of the soul, yet it could only go so far.

01:06.520 --> 01:11.160
Scientific experiments require proof, repeatability, and verification.

01:11.160 --> 01:17.120
Decades passed, and aside from Pania, no one else has achieved such critical results, making

01:17.120 --> 01:23.920
Pania's findings a singular piece of evidence and insufficient to prove the soul's existence.

01:23.920 --> 01:29.040
We've discussed soul weighing, soul photography, and out-of-body experiences, none of which

01:29.040 --> 01:33.720
sound particularly compelling or scientifically grounded.

01:33.720 --> 01:38.960
The most compelling explanation for the soul's existence comes from Sir Roger Penrose, a

01:38.960 --> 01:41.880
Nobel Prize-winning physicist.

01:41.880 --> 01:47.040
Penrose suggests the human brain isn't like traditional computers that rely on bit-by-bit

01:47.040 --> 01:48.480
computation.

01:48.480 --> 01:53.920
It resembles a quantum computer, using qubits to allow both zero and one to be computed

01:53.920 --> 01:55.820
simultaneously.

01:55.820 --> 01:58.160
He gave a typical example.

01:58.280 --> 02:03.920
When thinking about what to eat, whether apples, fried chicken, or fries, one doesn't sequentially

02:03.920 --> 02:09.600
consider fried chicken, then apples and fries, but thinks about them all at once.

02:09.600 --> 02:14.600
In this state, the qubits are entangled, like SchrÃ¶dinger's cat, which exists in a state

02:14.600 --> 02:17.240
of life and death until observed.

02:17.240 --> 02:22.480
Similarly, when the brain decides what to eat, the wave function collapses, and a decision

02:22.480 --> 02:24.080
is made instantly.

02:24.400 --> 02:29.560
However, Penrose has yet to find traces of quantum computing in brain tissue.

02:32.240 --> 02:37.080
In the 1990s, Stuart Hameroff, the director of the Center for Consciousness Studies at

02:37.080 --> 02:43.200
the University of Arizona, read Penrose's The Emperor's New Mind and realized a magical

02:43.200 --> 02:46.080
structure exists in the human brain.

02:46.080 --> 02:51.080
Microtubules, filamentous structures that help form the skeleton of neurons and other

02:51.080 --> 02:57.040
cells, may allow electrons to exist simultaneously in the universe and the brain, suggesting

02:57.040 --> 03:02.960
our soul is half in the brain and half somewhere deep in the universe, entangled regardless

03:02.960 --> 03:05.440
of distance.

03:05.440 --> 03:10.800
Penrose and Hameroff called this orchestrated objective reduction theory.

03:10.800 --> 03:16.640
According to their research, quantum is immortal, meaning even after death, the entangled quantum

03:16.640 --> 03:20.960
remains, akin to the traditional notion of ghosts.

03:21.360 --> 03:25.760
Mainstream science harshly criticized the theory upon its introduction, with no one

03:25.760 --> 03:30.760
knowing if microtubule electrons could achieve quantum superposition or equipment to prove

03:30.760 --> 03:31.760
it.

03:31.760 --> 03:38.160
Moreover, neuroscientists note the cerebellum, filled with neurons and microtubules, doesn't

03:38.160 --> 03:42.080
affect consciousness even when severely damaged.

03:42.080 --> 03:47.200
It's unlikely the soul resides only in the brain and not the cerebellum.

03:47.240 --> 03:51.760
Many believe Penrose's research veered off course, but the Nobel Committee showed more

03:51.760 --> 03:54.720
tolerance and rationality.

03:54.720 --> 03:59.720
Regardless of Penrose's controversial views, his contribution to science cannot be erased.
