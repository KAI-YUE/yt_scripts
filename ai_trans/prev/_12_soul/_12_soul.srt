00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
In the book, Penrose first articulated a shocking idea about the existence of the soul.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,040
Is there really a soul?

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,800
The soul is considered a supernatural phenomenon, an intangible and invisible essence.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,160
It's speculated that the soul can exist independently from the body and possesses the characteristics

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,900
of being indestructible.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,440
Discussing the eternity of the soul, in essence, is discussing life and death.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,480
Many websites have conducted similar surveys, and among 100,000 people, 63% believe in the

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,040
existence of the soul, while 37% think it's a superstition.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,640
There are actually many ways to prove the existence of the soul, and one of the earliest

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,480
researchers was Duncan McDougall, also known as the first person to attempt to weigh the

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,920
soul.

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,200
The story goes back to April 10, 1901.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,460
McDougall conducted a remarkable experiment to weigh the soul, starting with the hypothesis

14
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,280
that the soul has weight.

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,780
Like ancient legends suggest, the soul leaves the body to ascend to the sky at the moment

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,780
of death.

17
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,120
Thus, if one could precisely record the weight lost at the moment of death, that weight could

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,720
very likely be the weight of the soul.

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,680
It was an imaginative experiment that fascinated many.

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:32,760
McDougall constructed a huge, precise balance scale with an error margin of only 0.5%.

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,240
The brilliance of McDougall's invention was that it allowed a hospital bed to be placed

22
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,480
directly on the scale for weighing.

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,640
One day, after receiving a notification from the hospital that a volunteer who had been

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,280
pre-arranged might pass away that day, McDougall immediately set off with all his assistance

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,680
and equipment.

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,040
Unfortunately, this time, the patient had already passed away before they could get

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,400
him onto the device.

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,680
Half a year later, another volunteer was on the brink of death.

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,880
This time, unlike before, McDougall and his team had pushed the patient and the hospital

30
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,440
bed onto the scale a few days in advance.

31
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,840
Not wanting to waste any time, McDougall and his assistants lived near the hospital.

32
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,360
One afternoon, they received a notification from the hospital that the patient was expected

33
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,080
to die that day.

34
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,280
McDougall arrived at the designated spot in just ten minutes.

35
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,820
After a wait of four hours and six minutes, the patient took his last breath in the presence

36
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,480
of his family.

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,160
Suddenly, McDougall noticed the scale's pointer begin to move.

38
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:45,300
After 47 seconds, the pointer rapidly dropped and finally stopped at a certain value.

39
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,120
At that moment, McDougall witnessed the difference in weight before and after the patient's

40
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,680
death as 21 grams.

41
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,560
Obtaining such data for the first time excited McDougall.

42
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,120
He believed he had made a significant discovery.

43
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,720
Not only do humans have souls, but their weight is 21 grams.

44
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,120
Over the next three years, McDougall found dozens of volunteers, but his luck seemed

45
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,440
to have run out.

46
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,560
The experiments never succeeded again, either because the time of death couldn't be proven

47
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,680
or there were issues with the scale itself.

48
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,500
After three more attempts, the most significant reduction occurred when a patient's weight

49
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,540
dropped by 43 grams at the moment of death and then decreased by another 28 grams a few

50
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,540
minutes later.

51
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,880
Why did the weight drop in two stages?

52
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,920
Even McDougall himself couldn't figure out the reason.

53
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:45,640
McDougall, after several experiments, realized that using humans was not just complicated.

54
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,240
The presence of people around the deceased could create tension, possibly affecting the

55
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,040
accuracy of the experiment.

56
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,360
McDougall then ceased using humans and began using animals as subjects, first choosing

57
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,400
dogs for the experiment.

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,740
However, at the moment of the dogs' deaths, the scales pointer did not move at all.

59
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,120
After dozens of soul-weighing experiments on dogs, the results were all the same.

60
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,360
The scales pointer remained still.

61
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,840
Could it be that dogs do not possess souls?

62
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,200
After more than 10 experiments on various other animals of different sizes, the results

63
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,960
were still puzzling.

64
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,720
The New York Times also reported on McDougall's experiments.

65
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,440
Suddenly, the soul-weighing experiment sparked interest among many.

66
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,820
Although McDougall's multiple experiments failed to produce accurate and effective conclusions,

67
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,400
the claim of the soul weighing 21 grams spread far and wide.

68
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
