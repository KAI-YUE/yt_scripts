00:00.001 --> 00:08.280
In the book, Penrose first articulated a shocking idea about the existence of the soul.

00:08.280 --> 00:10.040
Is there really a soul?

00:10.040 --> 00:15.800
The soul is considered a supernatural phenomenon, an intangible and invisible essence.

00:15.800 --> 00:21.160
It's speculated that the soul can exist independently from the body and possesses the characteristics

00:21.160 --> 00:23.900
of being indestructible.

00:23.900 --> 00:29.440
Discussing the eternity of the soul, in essence, is discussing life and death.

00:29.440 --> 00:35.480
Many websites have conducted similar surveys, and among 100,000 people, 63% believe in the

00:35.480 --> 00:41.040
existence of the soul, while 37% think it's a superstition.

00:41.040 --> 00:45.640
There are actually many ways to prove the existence of the soul, and one of the earliest

00:45.640 --> 00:50.480
researchers was Duncan McDougall, also known as the first person to attempt to weigh the

00:50.480 --> 00:53.920
soul.

00:53.920 --> 00:58.200
The story goes back to April 10, 1901.

00:58.200 --> 01:03.460
McDougall conducted a remarkable experiment to weigh the soul, starting with the hypothesis

01:03.460 --> 01:06.280
that the soul has weight.

01:06.280 --> 01:11.780
Like ancient legends suggest, the soul leaves the body to ascend to the sky at the moment

01:11.780 --> 01:12.780
of death.

01:12.780 --> 01:18.120
Thus, if one could precisely record the weight lost at the moment of death, that weight could

01:18.120 --> 01:20.720
very likely be the weight of the soul.

01:20.720 --> 01:24.680
It was an imaginative experiment that fascinated many.

01:24.680 --> 01:32.760
McDougall constructed a huge, precise balance scale with an error margin of only 0.5%.

01:32.760 --> 01:37.240
The brilliance of McDougall's invention was that it allowed a hospital bed to be placed

01:37.240 --> 01:40.480
directly on the scale for weighing.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.640
One day, after receiving a notification from the hospital that a volunteer who had been

01:44.640 --> 01:50.280
pre-arranged might pass away that day, McDougall immediately set off with all his assistance

01:50.280 --> 01:51.680
and equipment.

01:51.680 --> 01:56.040
Unfortunately, this time, the patient had already passed away before they could get

01:56.040 --> 01:58.400
him onto the device.

01:58.400 --> 02:02.680
Half a year later, another volunteer was on the brink of death.

02:02.680 --> 02:07.880
This time, unlike before, McDougall and his team had pushed the patient and the hospital

02:07.880 --> 02:11.440
bed onto the scale a few days in advance.

02:11.440 --> 02:16.840
Not wanting to waste any time, McDougall and his assistants lived near the hospital.

02:16.840 --> 02:21.360
One afternoon, they received a notification from the hospital that the patient was expected

02:21.360 --> 02:24.080
to die that day.

02:24.080 --> 02:28.280
McDougall arrived at the designated spot in just ten minutes.

02:28.280 --> 02:32.820
After a wait of four hours and six minutes, the patient took his last breath in the presence

02:32.820 --> 02:34.480
of his family.

02:34.480 --> 02:39.160
Suddenly, McDougall noticed the scale's pointer begin to move.

02:39.160 --> 02:45.300
After 47 seconds, the pointer rapidly dropped and finally stopped at a certain value.

02:45.300 --> 02:50.120
At that moment, McDougall witnessed the difference in weight before and after the patient's

02:50.120 --> 02:52.680
death as 21 grams.

02:52.680 --> 02:56.560
Obtaining such data for the first time excited McDougall.

02:56.560 --> 03:00.120
He believed he had made a significant discovery.

03:00.120 --> 03:05.720
Not only do humans have souls, but their weight is 21 grams.

03:05.720 --> 03:10.120
Over the next three years, McDougall found dozens of volunteers, but his luck seemed

03:10.120 --> 03:11.440
to have run out.

03:11.440 --> 03:16.560
The experiments never succeeded again, either because the time of death couldn't be proven

03:16.560 --> 03:19.680
or there were issues with the scale itself.

03:19.680 --> 03:24.500
After three more attempts, the most significant reduction occurred when a patient's weight

03:24.500 --> 03:30.540
dropped by 43 grams at the moment of death and then decreased by another 28 grams a few

03:30.540 --> 03:31.540
minutes later.

03:31.540 --> 03:35.880
Why did the weight drop in two stages?

03:35.880 --> 03:38.920
Even McDougall himself couldn't figure out the reason.

03:38.920 --> 03:45.640
McDougall, after several experiments, realized that using humans was not just complicated.

03:45.640 --> 03:50.240
The presence of people around the deceased could create tension, possibly affecting the

03:50.240 --> 03:53.040
accuracy of the experiment.

03:53.040 --> 03:58.360
McDougall then ceased using humans and began using animals as subjects, first choosing

03:58.360 --> 04:00.400
dogs for the experiment.

04:00.400 --> 04:06.740
However, at the moment of the dogs' deaths, the scales pointer did not move at all.

04:06.740 --> 04:11.120
After dozens of soul-weighing experiments on dogs, the results were all the same.

04:11.120 --> 04:14.360
The scales pointer remained still.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.840
Could it be that dogs do not possess souls?

04:17.840 --> 04:22.200
After more than 10 experiments on various other animals of different sizes, the results

04:22.200 --> 04:23.960
were still puzzling.

04:23.960 --> 04:27.720
The New York Times also reported on McDougall's experiments.

04:27.720 --> 04:32.440
Suddenly, the soul-weighing experiment sparked interest among many.

04:32.440 --> 04:37.820
Although McDougall's multiple experiments failed to produce accurate and effective conclusions,

04:37.820 --> 04:41.400
the claim of the soul weighing 21 grams spread far and wide.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.360
