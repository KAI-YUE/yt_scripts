1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,080
Is there no other way to explore the existence of the soul besides weighing it?

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,520
Good question.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,160
The year is 1997 and a biology professor from the St. Petersburg State Technical University

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,000
in Russia named Konstantin Korotkov wanted to photograph the soul.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,600
How did he come up with such an idea?

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:32,480
It all began in the 1970s when the young Korotkov met an elderly electrical engineer.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,240
Initially he didn't pay much attention until one day he was invited by the KGB.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,600
The KGB wanted to know if any peculiar Europeans had been studying the elderly engineer's

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,260
work, cautioning Korotkov to beware of ulterior motives and prevent foreign spies from stealing

10
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,320
the National Treasure Engineer's technology.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,840
This engineer was Semyon Davidovich Kirlian, who, in 1937, was repairing an electrotherapy

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,360
device when he noticed sparks of electrical discharge between his hand and the glass-covered

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,600
electrode.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,140
Curious, he sought to capture this phenomenon on film.

15
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,520
After countless attempts, Kirlian discovered a method, later known as Kirlian photography.

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,200
His photographs gradually gained popularity in Western Europe, where people believed the

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,680
material halos shown in the pictures were proof of a universal spirit, validating the

18
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,320
existence of a soul field.

19
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,160
Thus, audacious Westerners sneaked into St Petersburg to interview Kirlian.

20
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,160
After learning the whole story, Korotkov thought it better to learn the technique himself rather

21
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,640
than let others do so.

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,360
He visited Kirlian's home to learn the method and found the principle surprisingly simple,

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,440
later improving upon the photographic technique.

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,480
Korotkov then created a series of scientific equipment and, with everything ready, invited

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,360
a photojournalist to witness the soul's photography.

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,000
He placed the patient on a glass device connected to an electrode and, at the moment of the

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,160
patient's death, took numerous continuous exposure shots.

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,080
Eventually, he selected the most representative two photos for comparison.

29
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,760
A bluish phantom halo appeared on the deceased, which Korotkov believed represented the soul

30
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,320
gradually leaving the body.

31
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:31,120
While Korotkov's experiment seemed fascinating, many doubted its validity.

32
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,560
Korotkov theorized the reduction of the bluish halo might be due to the massive die-off of

33
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,320
cells, slowly losing moisture and heat, though this alone couldn't definitively prove the

34
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,400
soul's existence.

35
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,000
He suggested more persuasive experimental data and a method to capture every moment

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,360
of the soul's departure were needed to conclusively prove the soul's presence.

37
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,000
Most netizens believed Korotkov's initial experiments didn't necessarily indicate failure,

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,200
merely that the equipment couldn't achieve the desired results.

39
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,160
Despite the experiment feeling inconclusive, the idea of photographing the soul became

40
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,080
quite popular worldwide.

41
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,360
In Detroit, USA, a soul photography studio was opened, claiming every photographed customer

42
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,680
would exhibit a unique soul halo in color and size, reportedly doing good business.

43
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,840
Within a year, three more branches were opened in Seattle, attracting many curious customers.

44
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,440
Some were so fascinated, they wished to start their own soul photography studios.

45
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,640
On June 20, 2001, the University of Houston invited a British doctor to present a similar

46
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,880
experiment on souls.

47
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,200
His report sparked a significant increase in believers of the soul's existence.

48
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,880
Pania, originally a specialist in the field of cardiac arrest and resuscitation, had saved

49
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,040
many patients on the brink of death.

50
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,840
After resuscitation, many described a peculiar sensation to Pania, seemingly observing themselves

51
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,880
lying on the bed.
