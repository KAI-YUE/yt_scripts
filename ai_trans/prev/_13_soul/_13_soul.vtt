00:00.001 --> 00:10.080
Is there no other way to explore the existence of the soul besides weighing it?

00:10.080 --> 00:11.520
Good question.

00:11.520 --> 00:17.160
The year is 1997 and a biology professor from the St. Petersburg State Technical University

00:17.160 --> 00:23.000
in Russia named Konstantin Korotkov wanted to photograph the soul.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.600
How did he come up with such an idea?

00:26.600 --> 00:32.480
It all began in the 1970s when the young Korotkov met an elderly electrical engineer.

00:32.480 --> 00:38.240
Initially he didn't pay much attention until one day he was invited by the KGB.

00:38.240 --> 00:43.600
The KGB wanted to know if any peculiar Europeans had been studying the elderly engineer's

00:43.600 --> 00:49.260
work, cautioning Korotkov to beware of ulterior motives and prevent foreign spies from stealing

00:49.260 --> 00:52.320
the National Treasure Engineer's technology.

00:52.320 --> 00:58.840
This engineer was Semyon Davidovich Kirlian, who, in 1937, was repairing an electrotherapy

00:58.840 --> 01:04.360
device when he noticed sparks of electrical discharge between his hand and the glass-covered

01:04.360 --> 01:05.600
electrode.

01:05.600 --> 01:10.140
Curious, he sought to capture this phenomenon on film.

01:10.140 --> 01:16.520
After countless attempts, Kirlian discovered a method, later known as Kirlian photography.

01:16.520 --> 01:21.200
His photographs gradually gained popularity in Western Europe, where people believed the

01:21.200 --> 01:26.680
material halos shown in the pictures were proof of a universal spirit, validating the

01:26.680 --> 01:29.320
existence of a soul field.

01:29.320 --> 01:35.160
Thus, audacious Westerners sneaked into St Petersburg to interview Kirlian.

01:35.160 --> 01:40.160
After learning the whole story, Korotkov thought it better to learn the technique himself rather

01:40.160 --> 01:42.640
than let others do so.

01:42.640 --> 01:48.360
He visited Kirlian's home to learn the method and found the principle surprisingly simple,

01:48.360 --> 01:51.440
later improving upon the photographic technique.

01:51.440 --> 01:57.480
Korotkov then created a series of scientific equipment and, with everything ready, invited

01:57.480 --> 02:01.360
a photojournalist to witness the soul's photography.

02:01.360 --> 02:07.000
He placed the patient on a glass device connected to an electrode and, at the moment of the

02:07.000 --> 02:11.160
patient's death, took numerous continuous exposure shots.

02:11.160 --> 02:16.080
Eventually, he selected the most representative two photos for comparison.

02:16.080 --> 02:21.760
A bluish phantom halo appeared on the deceased, which Korotkov believed represented the soul

02:21.760 --> 02:24.320
gradually leaving the body.

02:24.320 --> 02:31.120
While Korotkov's experiment seemed fascinating, many doubted its validity.

02:31.120 --> 02:36.560
Korotkov theorized the reduction of the bluish halo might be due to the massive die-off of

02:36.560 --> 02:42.320
cells, slowly losing moisture and heat, though this alone couldn't definitively prove the

02:42.320 --> 02:44.400
soul's existence.

02:44.400 --> 02:50.000
He suggested more persuasive experimental data and a method to capture every moment

02:50.000 --> 02:56.360
of the soul's departure were needed to conclusively prove the soul's presence.

02:56.360 --> 03:02.000
Most netizens believed Korotkov's initial experiments didn't necessarily indicate failure,

03:02.000 --> 03:06.200
merely that the equipment couldn't achieve the desired results.

03:06.200 --> 03:11.160
Despite the experiment feeling inconclusive, the idea of photographing the soul became

03:11.160 --> 03:14.080
quite popular worldwide.

03:14.080 --> 03:20.360
In Detroit, USA, a soul photography studio was opened, claiming every photographed customer

03:20.360 --> 03:26.680
would exhibit a unique soul halo in color and size, reportedly doing good business.

03:26.680 --> 03:32.840
Within a year, three more branches were opened in Seattle, attracting many curious customers.

03:32.840 --> 03:38.440
Some were so fascinated, they wished to start their own soul photography studios.

03:38.440 --> 03:44.640
On June 20, 2001, the University of Houston invited a British doctor to present a similar

03:44.640 --> 03:46.880
experiment on souls.

03:46.880 --> 03:52.200
His report sparked a significant increase in believers of the soul's existence.

03:52.200 --> 03:57.880
Pania, originally a specialist in the field of cardiac arrest and resuscitation, had saved

03:57.880 --> 04:01.040
many patients on the brink of death.

04:01.040 --> 04:06.840
After resuscitation, many described a peculiar sensation to Pania, seemingly observing themselves

04:06.840 --> 04:07.880
lying on the bed.
