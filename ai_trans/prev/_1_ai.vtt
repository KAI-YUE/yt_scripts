Hello, I'm Dr. K. Today we are diving into AI and human life speed.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
You've probably noticed that the AI revolution is speeding up.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
Like generative AI can turn your imagination into images or videos.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
I would say this is a real game changer for movies and game creators.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Even in terms of computer programming.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
I mean, it can whip up a website for you within 10 to 20 minutes.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
Imagine that 30 years back, if you want to build a website like Amazon, you need a team of top engineers.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Now, even a noob can get AI to help him implement it.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
As an expert in this field, I would say this is really revolutionary.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
But there's a catch.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
These AI tools often have an input limit or time limit.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
Like Microsoft's Bing, it capsules away 2,000 to 4,000 words.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
When it's answering a question, it feels like it's counting each word.

01:16.000 --> 01:24.000
And the new Solar project by OpenAI can only generate 1 to 2 minute videos.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
Good point. It seems like these mega companies are just gouting their computational power.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
Or they're intentionally adding a lifespan to these AI programs.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
Yuri, have you ever wondered about why human beings have lifespans?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
First up, telomeres.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
Our DNAs like coding or text in a book.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
DNAs pretty much set up everything for us.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Your looks, your smartness, you name it.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Imagine your body's information is a huge library.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
And those 46 chromosomes in each cell of your body, they're just like 46 books.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
The contents in these books shape us.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
Telomeres are just like borrow cards on the pocket of the cover.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
Where every time the cell copies itself, a line on the borrow card will be gone.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
When the card is used up, no more borrowing, no more renew.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
It means the cell cannot split anymore.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
It means those cells have reached their lifespans.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
Research says telomere lengths can predict lifespan pretty well.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
For example, women's telomere lengths are longer than men's.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Hence, women generally outlive men.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
In the U.S., women live about five to six years longer than men.
