00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,600
Hi, this is Dr. K. Today we will talk about the scientific evidence of souls.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,960
Yuri, you said you were in a coma for 13 months and you eventually woke up.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,080
But people around you felt like you had become a different person, right?

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,960
So do you believe in the existence of the soul?

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,960
I felt like I was in a vast real desert at that time.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,040
It's very possible that was your soul wandering between the past and the present life.

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,080
Today we'll talk about the scientific evidence of the soul.

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:45,320
In 2020, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the Nobel Prize winners in physics.

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,080
The moment the first winner was announced, everyone was surprised.

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,320
Many couldn't believe their ears.

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,920
The winner was Roger Penrose, a nearly 100-year-old man who had been promoting a fantastical theory

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,800
for nearly 20 years, which he called quantum soul.

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,800
Quantum soul.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,960
In the future, if I get a chance, I will explain quantum theory to you.

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,440
In short, he believes that the soul truly exists.

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:19,360
In the eyes of mainstream physicists, this nearly 100-year-old man seemed a bit senile,

17
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,960
lamenting how a good physicist suddenly turned to mysticism.

18
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,360
Isn't that a big joke?

19
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,400
However, this highly controversial scholar was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Physics

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Committee, and things started to become more intriguing.

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,800
What is the soul?

22
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,080
Does it truly exist in our world?

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,320
Could the quantum soul really exist?

24
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,280
To unravel the truth about the soul, we must start from the beginning.

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,240
Roger Penrose was a prodigy from the start.

26
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,360
In his early 20s, he discovered and described several mathematical theorems, hailed as a

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,360
rare mathematical genius at Oxford University.

28
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,520
The 1950s was the era when Einstein's theory of general relativity was popular because

29
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,480
research in general relativity required profound mathematical knowledge.

30
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,460
Penrose entered the field of physics as a mathematician, and he became close friends

31
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,560
with Stephen Hawking.

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,640
Penrose developed a concept singularity using mathematical methods, which is infinitely

33
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,920
small in volume, yet infinitely dense.

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,360
However, Hawking sensitively proposed a more dynamic view, suggesting that the universe

35
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,680
might have originated from a point becoming what it is today after a big bang.

36
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,000
Through calculations, Penrose predicted that the collapse of a massive star would form

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,920
a singularity, what we know as the center of a black hole.

38
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,960
Penrose also won the Nobel Prize for this remarkable achievement.

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,520
Due to Penrose's significant contributions in mathematics and physics, Queen Elizabeth

40
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,040
II awarded him a knighthood in 1994.

41
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,200
Hence, he is known as Sir Roger Penrose.

42
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,240
But this scientific giant published a book in 1989, The Emperor's New Mind.
