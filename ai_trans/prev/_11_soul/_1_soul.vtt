Hi, this is Dr. K. Today we will talk about the scientific evidence of souls.

00:10.600 --> 00:15.960
Yuri, you said you were in a coma for 13 months and you eventually woke up.

00:15.960 --> 00:20.080
But people around you felt like you had become a different person, right?

00:20.080 --> 00:22.960
So do you believe in the existence of the soul?

00:22.960 --> 00:27.960
I felt like I was in a vast real desert at that time.

00:27.960 --> 00:33.040
It's very possible that was your soul wandering between the past and the present life.

00:33.040 --> 00:39.080
Today we'll talk about the scientific evidence of the soul.

00:39.080 --> 00:45.320
In 2020, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the Nobel Prize winners in physics.

00:45.320 --> 00:49.080
The moment the first winner was announced, everyone was surprised.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.320
Many couldn't believe their ears.

00:51.320 --> 00:57.920
The winner was Roger Penrose, a nearly 100-year-old man who had been promoting a fantastical theory

00:57.920 --> 01:02.800
for nearly 20 years, which he called quantum soul.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.800
Quantum soul.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.960
In the future, if I get a chance, I will explain quantum theory to you.

01:08.960 --> 01:13.440
In short, he believes that the soul truly exists.

01:13.440 --> 01:19.360
In the eyes of mainstream physicists, this nearly 100-year-old man seemed a bit senile,

01:19.360 --> 01:22.960
lamenting how a good physicist suddenly turned to mysticism.

01:22.960 --> 01:25.360
Isn't that a big joke?

01:25.360 --> 01:30.400
However, this highly controversial scholar was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Physics

01:30.400 --> 01:34.400
Committee, and things started to become more intriguing.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.800
What is the soul?

01:35.800 --> 01:38.080
Does it truly exist in our world?

01:38.080 --> 01:41.320
Could the quantum soul really exist?

01:41.320 --> 01:48.280
To unravel the truth about the soul, we must start from the beginning.

01:48.280 --> 01:51.240
Roger Penrose was a prodigy from the start.

01:51.240 --> 01:56.360
In his early 20s, he discovered and described several mathematical theorems, hailed as a

01:56.360 --> 02:00.360
rare mathematical genius at Oxford University.

02:00.360 --> 02:05.520
The 1950s was the era when Einstein's theory of general relativity was popular because

02:05.520 --> 02:10.480
research in general relativity required profound mathematical knowledge.

02:10.480 --> 02:14.460
Penrose entered the field of physics as a mathematician, and he became close friends

02:14.460 --> 02:16.560
with Stephen Hawking.

02:16.560 --> 02:21.640
Penrose developed a concept singularity using mathematical methods, which is infinitely

02:21.640 --> 02:24.920
small in volume, yet infinitely dense.

02:24.920 --> 02:30.360
However, Hawking sensitively proposed a more dynamic view, suggesting that the universe

02:30.360 --> 02:36.680
might have originated from a point becoming what it is today after a big bang.

02:36.680 --> 02:42.000
Through calculations, Penrose predicted that the collapse of a massive star would form

02:42.000 --> 02:47.920
a singularity, what we know as the center of a black hole.

02:47.920 --> 02:52.960
Penrose also won the Nobel Prize for this remarkable achievement.

02:52.960 --> 02:57.520
Due to Penrose's significant contributions in mathematics and physics, Queen Elizabeth

02:57.520 --> 03:01.040
II awarded him a knighthood in 1994.

03:01.040 --> 03:05.200
Hence, he is known as Sir Roger Penrose.

03:05.200 --> 03:10.240
But this scientific giant published a book in 1989, The Emperor's New Mind.
