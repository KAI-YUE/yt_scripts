Hello, I'm Dr. K. Today we are diving into AI and human life speed.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You've probably noticed that the AI revolution is speeding up.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Like generative AI can turn your imagination into images or videos.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I would say this is a real game changer for movies and game creators.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Even in terms of computer programming.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I mean, it can whip up a website for you within 10 to 20 minutes.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Imagine that 30 years back, if you want to build a website like Amazon, you need a team of top engineers.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now, even a noob can get AI to help him implement it.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
As an expert in this field, I would say this is really revolutionary.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But there's a catch.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
These AI tools often have an input limit or time limit.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Like Microsoft's Bing, it capsules away 2,000 to 4,000 words.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
When it's answering a question, it feels like it's counting each word.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And the new Solar project by OpenAI can only generate 1 to 2 minute videos.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Good point. It seems like these mega companies are just gouting their computational power.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Or they're intentionally adding a lifespan to these AI programs.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yuri, have you ever wondered about why human beings have lifespans?

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
First up, telomeres.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Our DNAs like coding or text in a book.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
DNAs pretty much set up everything for us.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Your looks, your smartness, you name it.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Imagine your body's information is a huge library.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And those 46 chromosomes in each cell of your body, they're just like 46 books.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The contents in these books shape us.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Telomeres are just like borrow cards on the pocket of the cover.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Where every time the cell copies itself, a line on the borrow card will be gone.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
When the card is used up, no more borrowing, no more renew.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It means the cell cannot split anymore.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It means those cells have reached their lifespans.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Research says telomere lengths can predict lifespan pretty well.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
For example, women's telomere lengths are longer than men's.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hence, women generally outlive men.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In the U.S., women live about five to six years longer than men.
