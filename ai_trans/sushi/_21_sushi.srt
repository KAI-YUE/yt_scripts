1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yori, considering your Japanese roots, are there any Japanese dishes you'd recommend?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh, absolutely. Sushi, sashimi, sukiyaki, Japanese barbecue, and for everyday meals,

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I love a simple bowl of rice mixed with a raw egg.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You need to be careful in the United States.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Supermarket raw eggs and fish don't quite cut it for making authentic sashimi.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No worries. I usually stick to dining at reputable restaurants.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But even the most reputable establishments can sometimes slip up.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In Japan, you'll find that people are constantly getting infected by parasites.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Despite the common practice of eating sashimi in their culture, the Japanese are not immune to fish parasites.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
In coastal regions of Japan, the most advanced medical departments are those treating parasites.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Today, I'll delve into a culinary tale from Japan.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A story of a dish that, due to a singular incident, faced nationwide prohibition.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The story begins with a dish called something like basashi in Japanese.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It is the beef liver sashimi.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Imagine thinly sliced beef liver, delicately seasoned with sesame seeds, green onions, a pinch of salt,

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
a dash of pepper, and a drizzle of sesame oil, all savored raw.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Its surprisingly gentle and sweet taste, combined with a texture that's both tender and bouncy,

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
makes it an unforgettable delicacy.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This was a dish I, along with countless others in Japan, would not miss ordering it.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
However, following an incident a decade ago, it vanished from Japanese menus.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It was on April 22, 2011, in Toyama Prefecture, Japan.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
A man named Kubo rushes home from work to celebrate his son's 14th birthday.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Craving barbecue, the family heads to their neighborhood's affordable grill spot, Yakiniku Ebisu.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Known for their budget-friendly prices, thanks to bulk purchasing that keeps costs low,

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
this eatery offers dishes like pork neck, belly, chicken skin,

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and even the most expensive Wagyu beef for roughly 100 yen to 380 yen.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
They are approximately 66 cents to three bucks in U.S. dollars.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Their guarantee to customers is, your satisfaction is on us.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It was this reputation for value and quality that had landed them features on numerous Japanese TV food shows,

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and why Kubo's son had his heart set on celebrating there.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Among their orders of various grilled meats, Kubo and his sons each indulged in a 280-yen beef tartare.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Raw beef threads mixed with a custom sauce and an egg yolk, yielding a creamy, rich flavor.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That night, they left satiated and happy.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But joy turned to concern when, the next afternoon, Kubo's son began experiencing severe stomach pain, diarrhea, and vomiting.

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Initially attributing it to a minor ailment, the situation rapidly worsened,

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
leading to a hospital visit where they were diagnosed with an E. coli infection,

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
a strain deadly enough to cause severe symptoms and even acute kidney failure.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This bacterium's insidious nature lies in its potency.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
A mere 10 to 100 bacteria can cause infection, showcasing its alarming infectiousness.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The Kubo family's shared meal, not mindful of using separate serving utensils, allowed the bacteria to spread.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Six days post-dinner, the youngest Kubo was admitted to the ICU with hemolytic uremic syndrome,

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
unfortunately passing away six months later.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The outbreak ultimately affected 181 individuals, with five tragic fatalities.
