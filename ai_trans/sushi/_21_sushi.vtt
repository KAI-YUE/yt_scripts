00:00.001 --> 00:09.000
Yori, considering your Japanese roots, are there any Japanese dishes you'd recommend?

00:09.000 --> 00:18.000
Oh, absolutely. Sushi, sashimi, sukiyaki, Japanese barbecue, and for everyday meals,

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
I love a simple bowl of rice mixed with a raw egg.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
You need to be careful in the United States.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
Supermarket raw eggs and fish don't quite cut it for making authentic sashimi.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
No worries. I usually stick to dining at reputable restaurants.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
But even the most reputable establishments can sometimes slip up.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
In Japan, you'll find that people are constantly getting infected by parasites.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
Despite the common practice of eating sashimi in their culture, the Japanese are not immune to fish parasites.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
In coastal regions of Japan, the most advanced medical departments are those treating parasites.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Today, I'll delve into a culinary tale from Japan.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
A story of a dish that, due to a singular incident, faced nationwide prohibition.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
The story begins with a dish called something like basashi in Japanese.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
It is the beef liver sashimi.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
Imagine thinly sliced beef liver, delicately seasoned with sesame seeds, green onions, a pinch of salt,

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
a dash of pepper, and a drizzle of sesame oil, all savored raw.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
Its surprisingly gentle and sweet taste, combined with a texture that's both tender and bouncy,

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
makes it an unforgettable delicacy.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
This was a dish I, along with countless others in Japan, would not miss ordering it.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
However, following an incident a decade ago, it vanished from Japanese menus.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
It was on April 22, 2011, in Toyama Prefecture, Japan.

01:55.000 --> 02:02.000
A man named Kubo rushes home from work to celebrate his son's 14th birthday.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
Craving barbecue, the family heads to their neighborhood's affordable grill spot, Yakiniku Ebisu.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
Known for their budget-friendly prices, thanks to bulk purchasing that keeps costs low,

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
this eatery offers dishes like pork neck, belly, chicken skin,

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
and even the most expensive Wagyu beef for roughly 100 yen to 380 yen.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
They are approximately 66 cents to three bucks in U.S. dollars.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
Their guarantee to customers is, your satisfaction is on us.

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
It was this reputation for value and quality that had landed them features on numerous Japanese TV food shows,

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
and why Kubo's son had his heart set on celebrating there.

02:47.000 --> 02:56.000
Among their orders of various grilled meats, Kubo and his sons each indulged in a 280-yen beef tartare.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
Raw beef threads mixed with a custom sauce and an egg yolk, yielding a creamy, rich flavor.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
That night, they left satiated and happy.

03:06.000 --> 03:16.000
But joy turned to concern when, the next afternoon, Kubo's son began experiencing severe stomach pain, diarrhea, and vomiting.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
Initially attributing it to a minor ailment, the situation rapidly worsened,

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
leading to a hospital visit where they were diagnosed with an E. coli infection,

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
a strain deadly enough to cause severe symptoms and even acute kidney failure.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
This bacterium's insidious nature lies in its potency.

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
A mere 10 to 100 bacteria can cause infection, showcasing its alarming infectiousness.

03:44.000 --> 03:52.000
The Kubo family's shared meal, not mindful of using separate serving utensils, allowed the bacteria to spread.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
Six days post-dinner, the youngest Kubo was admitted to the ICU with hemolytic uremic syndrome,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
unfortunately passing away six months later.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
The outbreak ultimately affected 181 individuals, with five tragic fatalities.
