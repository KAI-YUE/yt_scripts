00:00.001 --> 00:10.480
E. coli is a name familiar to many, yet there are various strains of E. coli.

00:10.480 --> 00:13.440
Most strains of E. coli are harmless to humans.

00:13.440 --> 00:19.500
However, the strain that infected the Kubo family, the hemorrhagic E. coli, is deadly.

00:19.500 --> 00:26.020
It can cause severe abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, and vomiting, and it may lead to hemolytic

00:26.020 --> 00:28.080
uremic syndrome.

00:28.080 --> 00:32.960
Once the E. coli reaches the colon, immune cells begin to attack.

00:32.960 --> 00:37.680
When these hemorrhagic E. coli bacteria are destroyed, they release a large amount of

00:37.680 --> 00:39.240
toxins.

00:39.240 --> 00:44.600
These toxins enter the bloodstream, attacking red blood cells and platelets while circulating

00:44.600 --> 00:46.400
throughout the body.

00:46.400 --> 00:51.520
If the toxins are not quickly expelled, they can cause acute brain inflammation and acute

00:51.520 --> 00:53.400
renal failure.

00:53.400 --> 00:58.560
This explains why the entire Kubo family was infected, but the youngest son had the most

00:58.560 --> 01:00.720
severe symptoms.

01:00.720 --> 01:05.760
Because he took antidiarrheal medication early in the complication, the accumulated toxins

01:05.760 --> 01:10.400
could not be expelled from the body, worsening his condition.

01:10.400 --> 01:16.480
This incident cast a spotlight on Yakiniku Ebisu, revealing laxes in their hygiene practices

01:16.480 --> 01:20.040
and handling of raw ingredients.

01:20.080 --> 01:25.160
Amid public outcry and legal battles, the restaurant's management faced bankruptcy,

01:25.160 --> 01:27.920
dodging compensation responsibilities.

01:27.920 --> 01:34.080
The subsequent legal ruling mandated a substantial payout to the victims but absolved the president

01:34.080 --> 01:41.080
of criminal liability, citing a lack of awareness about the risks of E. coli at the time.

01:41.080 --> 01:46.960
As the number of infections rose, the finger of blame pointed squarely at Yakiniku Ebisu,

01:46.960 --> 01:49.000
the barbecue restaurant.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.200
Netizens dug up footage from a previous TV interview showing staff wiping dishes with

01:54.200 --> 01:58.480
a cloth used for bathing and mixing meat with their bare hands.

01:58.480 --> 02:04.200
The video's release sparked a wave of angry emails directed at Ebisu.

02:04.200 --> 02:09.960
Facing public outrage, Ebisu's president held a press conference on May 2nd.

02:09.960 --> 02:15.960
Beyond apologizing, the president revealed more industry secrets not known to the public.

02:15.960 --> 02:16.960
What did this mean?

02:17.680 --> 02:21.520
E. coli, as the name suggests, resides in the colon.

02:21.520 --> 02:27.120
Thus, slaughterhouses process beef and offal separately to prevent bacteria from the innards

02:27.120 --> 02:28.920
contaminating the meat.

02:28.920 --> 02:34.520
However, that's not enough because the meat's surface is most prone to bacterial infection.

02:34.520 --> 02:42.520
So before serving raw meat dishes to customers, it's common for restaurants to trim the meat's surface.

02:42.600 --> 02:47.160
While Japanese law doesn't differentiate between raw and cooked beef standards, it

02:47.160 --> 02:51.640
does distinguish between trimmed and untrimmed edges.

02:51.640 --> 02:57.120
If followed correctly, even raw consumption shouldn't pose a high risk of infection.

02:57.120 --> 03:01.440
After all, the Japanese have been eating this way for years without issue.

03:01.440 --> 03:05.760
The problem was that Ebisu didn't follow the trimming process.

03:05.760 --> 03:09.800
It's presumed that during the slaughtering process, the intestines were accidentally

03:09.800 --> 03:14.360
ruptured, contaminating the beef with E. coli.

03:14.360 --> 03:19.760
Ebisu's failure to trim the edges and directly serving raw beef liver sashimi to customers

03:19.760 --> 03:22.080
led to the outbreak.

03:22.080 --> 03:26.560
During the press conference, the president seized on this point, suggesting that if the

03:26.560 --> 03:31.560
government truly cared for the citizens' welfare, it should ban restaurants from serving

03:31.560 --> 03:33.560
raw beef liver.

03:33.560 --> 03:38.680
This statement was seen by netizens as the president's shirking responsibility, especially

03:38.680 --> 03:44.560
since two six-year-old boys had already died, increasing public dissatisfaction.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.680
Days later, the president apologized again.

03:47.680 --> 03:51.160
However, no apology could undo the damage.

03:51.160 --> 03:56.200
Two more women who had dined at Ebisu passed away, along with the restaurateur's son in

03:56.200 --> 03:58.760
October six months later.

03:58.760 --> 04:03.720
In total, 181 people were infected and five died.

04:03.720 --> 04:07.520
Although the president promised to support the victims, he later filed for bankruptcy

04:07.520 --> 04:09.840
to evade compensation.

04:09.840 --> 04:14.920
The victims collectively sued Ebisu and its president, leading to a court ordering Ebisu

04:14.920 --> 04:19.480
to pay 169 million yen in compensation.

04:19.480 --> 04:24.680
However, due to a lack of awareness about hemorrhagic E. coli at the time, the court

04:24.680 --> 04:28.320
dismissed the criminal charges against the president.

04:28.320 --> 04:33.340
Following the incident, Japanese restaurants ceased serving raw beef liver.

04:33.340 --> 04:39.540
In October 2011, Japan officially enacted laws regarding the serving of raw meat, mandating

04:39.540 --> 04:43.900
strict processing and health department approval for sale.

04:43.900 --> 04:49.580
Raw beef liver sashimi was banned from July 2012 due to the discovery of hemorrhagic E.

04:49.580 --> 04:55.980
coli not only on the surface but also inside the liver, marking the end of its availability

04:55.980 --> 04:57.380
in Japanese restaurants.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.540
For health's sake, it's probably for the best.
