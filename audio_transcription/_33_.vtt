00:00.001 --> 00:11.000
Neither does it means going through the coma again, meeting you, makes it all worth it.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Oof, you're making me blush so much.

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
Finally, let's address some criticisms regarding the Pontare recurrence and its relation to our actual universe.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
First off, we can't be 100% sure that any physical system state will happen again.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
In addition, our universe might not meet the conditions for Pontare recurrence.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Our universe could be infinite, where energy and matter aren't concerned.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Of course, these are currently unprovable and unfalsifiable.

00:45.000 --> 00:55.000
In summary, time being infinite leads to Pontare recurrence, and space being infinite leads to parallel universes.

00:55.000 --> 01:04.000
The consistency of black hole physics suggests that the number of quantum states that can be accommodated in each Planck volume is finite.

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
This means, depending on the curvature of the universe, if the universe is closed, then every quantum state in the universe can be traversed,

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
indicating the inevitability of Pontare recurrence.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
However, if the universe is flat or open, Pontare recurrence in the universe may not necessarily happen.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
Mathematicians have proven it, that our audience might watch our video again tomorrow.
