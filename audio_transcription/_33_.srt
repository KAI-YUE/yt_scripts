00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Neither does it means going through the coma again, meeting you, makes it all worth it.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oof, you're making me blush so much.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Finally, let's address some criticisms regarding the Pontare recurrence and its relation to our actual universe.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
First off, we can't be 100% sure that any physical system state will happen again.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In addition, our universe might not meet the conditions for Pontare recurrence.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Our universe could be infinite, where energy and matter aren't concerned.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Of course, these are currently unprovable and unfalsifiable.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In summary, time being infinite leads to Pontare recurrence, and space being infinite leads to parallel universes.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The consistency of black hole physics suggests that the number of quantum states that can be accommodated in each Planck volume is finite.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This means, depending on the curvature of the universe, if the universe is closed, then every quantum state in the universe can be traversed,

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
indicating the inevitability of Pontare recurrence.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
However, if the universe is flat or open, Pontare recurrence in the universe may not necessarily happen.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Mathematicians have proven it, that our audience might watch our video again tomorrow.
