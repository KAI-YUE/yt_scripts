00:00.001 --> 00:06.000
I'm scientist Dr. K. The girl next to me is Yuri.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
I'm Yuri.

00:08.000 --> 00:17.000
The AI technology is advancing nowadays. Recently, the Solar Project can automatically convert text into video.

00:17.000 --> 00:29.000
As a developer, I believe this is revolutionary, not only to academia, but also to the movie industry, to games, and to everything else.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
Yes, but whether it's Tac-Bing or Sora, they all have usage time limitations. Continuous use becomes inconvenient.

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
That's true. Speaking of which, Yuri, do you know why humans have a lifespan?

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Oh, Dr. K, you're always bringing up deep topics.

00:52.000 --> 01:03.000
Actually, the fundamental logic of human lifespan limit could be the same of the usage limit of AI software.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Isn't it because of computational limitations?

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Not really. Today, I will focus on the topic of human lifespan.

01:13.000 --> 01:26.000
Maybe I will teach you how to extend the usage of the AI program, and maybe how to extend human lifespan or even achieve immortality.

01:26.000 --> 01:37.000
There are many hypotheses in biology about human lifespan, including the most famous telomere hypothesis.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
Human DNAs are like code snippets in a program or the text in a book.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
Texts in a book largely determine our genders, appearance, or intelligence.

01:51.000 --> 02:03.000
If we compel this information to books in library, then the 46 chromosomes in our body are just like 46 books.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Of course, these 46 books are paired in twos.

02:08.000 --> 02:17.000
In other words, the content of these books determine our appearance and intelligence.

02:17.000 --> 02:27.000
The first and last several pages of each book are known as special blank pages. We call them telomeres.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
After copying, some of the blank pages on both ends may get contaminated.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
When our body copies cells, we are actually copying these books.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
As a result, they may need to be turned out and discarded.

02:45.000 --> 02:55.000
Eventually, there will be no blank page left, and a book with only main text cannot replicate anymore.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
Yes, your cell cannot keep replicating itself.

03:00.000 --> 03:08.000
The current research has shown that the length of telomeres can accurately predict your lifespan.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
For example, the telomeres of females are longer than males.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
That's why statistically, females live longer than males.

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
In the United States, women live on average 5 to 6 years longer than men.

03:26.000 --> 03:35.000
So if we extend telomeres, can we extend lifespan? Does this relate to Jacked? Do they also have telomeres?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
There's no conclusive answer yet.

03:37.000 --> 03:47.000
It's still not clear whether the shortening of telomeres, those blank pages, is the cause or the result of our aging.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Of course, there are many other studies in biology.

03:50.000 --> 03:59.000
For example, research has also shown that your lifespan is correlated with your level of inflammation.

03:59.000 --> 04:10.000
Less stress and few illness can extend your lifespan in terms of reducing the level of inflammation in your body.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
That means being with Dr. K could add 5 to 10 years to life.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
We're sad. Of course, this is just a hypothesis.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
In fact, there are creatures on Earth that don't exactly follow this rule.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
And this means to a certain extent, they've achieved immortality.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
We will talk about it in later episodes.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
Beyond biology, today I mainly want to share with you about creationism.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
Everything's human's birth, they always have their religions.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
For example, Bible recorded human's origin.

04:50.000 --> 04:58.000
In the first chapter, God created everything in the world in six days and then rest for a day.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
That's why we have a seven-day week.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
God created Adam in His own image.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
And then He took a rib of Adam to create Eve.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Pay attention. There are a lot of details here.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
And devil is in a detail.

05:16.000 --> 05:23.000
According to Bible, God created Adam and Eve to manage His garden of Eden.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
Eden is a nice garden. It's close to the heaven.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
At its center, there was a tree of wisdom of good and evil.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
Before Adam and Eve began their life in Eden,

05:38.000 --> 05:47.000
God specifically instructed them that they could eat fruit of all trees except for the tree of wisdom.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
Adam and Eve enjoyed their life in Eden.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
One day, a serpent alerted Eve.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
And she ate a fruit of the tree of wisdom.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Eve also gave Adam the fruit.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
They realized that the naked body is something to be embarrassed about.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
God soon learned about this, and He became very anxious.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
So He banished them from Eden.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
God also arranged angels to protect the tree of life,

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
preventing them from achieving eternal life.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
You might feel some strangeness in this story.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
Actually, there are many details you can dig into.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
For example, first, as I said, God created Eve from Adam.

06:43.000 --> 06:50.000
And this is very similar compared to copying a template in modern computer systems.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
It's very normal for us to create a prototype and then copy and paste.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
In the Bible story, Eve was created from Adam's body,

07:03.000 --> 07:11.000
symbolizing not just a physical connection but also sharing the same origin and attributes.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
There's another intriguing detail in the story.

07:15.000 --> 07:23.000
After Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden, God asked somebody to protect the tree of life.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
This raises a question naturally.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Why didn't God do this from the beginning?

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
According to the law of attraction that has been introduced in the book Secret,

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
which if I got a chance, I will introduce in our later episode.

07:41.000 --> 07:48.000
So the law of attraction told us that our subconscious ignores negative words.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
It's like when you tell yourself,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
don't imagine a pink crocodile,

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
your mind immediately comes up with the image of a pink crocodile.

07:58.000 --> 08:08.000
So God's initial command not to eat the fruit on the tree of wisdom may encourage them to eat the fruit.

08:08.000 --> 08:15.000
It's very normal for us to create a prototype and then copy and paste.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
In the Bible story, Eve was created from Adam's body,

08:20.000 --> 08:28.000
symbolizing not just a physical connection but also sharing the same origin and attributes.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
There's another intriguing detail in the story.

08:32.000 --> 08:41.000
After Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden, God asked somebody to protect the tree of life.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
This raises a question naturally.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
Why didn't God do this from the beginning?

08:47.000 --> 08:53.000
According to the law of attraction that has been introduced in the book Secret,

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
which if I got a chance, I will introduce in our later episode.

08:58.000 --> 09:05.000
So the law of attraction told us that our subconscious ignores negative words.

09:05.000 --> 09:15.000
So God's initial command not to eat the fruit on the tree of wisdom may encourage them to eat the fruit.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
It's like when you tell yourself,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
don't imagine a pink crocodile,

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
your mind immediately comes up with the image of a pink crocodile.

09:26.000 --> 09:33.000
Actually, the tree was not only of wisdom but also of discerning good and evil.

09:33.000 --> 09:42.000
This means that your wisdom at least is as important as your moral judgment.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
Why did Eve, after gaining wisdom and knowledge of good and evil,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
share the fruit with her husband?

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
And why did they hide from the God after eating the fruit?

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
This reflects that even with wisdom and moral sense,

10:00.000 --> 10:08.000
people's actions and words can still be inconsistent with what they believe in their hearts.

10:08.000 --> 10:19.000
This is also why developing AI programs such as Chachabit to let them include ethical restrictions is very difficult.

10:19.000 --> 10:27.000
And even those engineers put so much effort into building the ethical framework in the Chachabit,

10:27.000 --> 10:34.000
many hackers were able to jailbreak Chachabit to obtain attacking code.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Huh?

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
Let's go back to the Bible story.

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
I would like to mention that the image of the serpent is also interesting.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Why is that a serpent that tempted Eve?

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
Snakes are reptiles similar to lizards.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
This may suggest that before human ancestors gained their intelligence,

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
the serpent were smarter or more cunning than human beings.

11:04.000 --> 11:13.000
So this story may also imply the existence and intelligence of lizard men before human ancestors.

11:13.000 --> 11:20.000
If I have a chance, I will explain all these mysteries point in future episodes.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
Hey, hey, how could you fall asleep?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Okay, here's the thing.

11:27.000 --> 11:35.000
If you can keep awake until the end of the story and answer the final question right,

11:35.000 --> 11:43.000
you can get a reward, like a gift card or cash back from our future month math findings.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
Huh, what I'm going to do with you, Yuri?

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
All right, let me answer your question.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
Initially, God didn't forbid eating from the tree of life.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
This implies He wasn't against Adam or Eve getting eternal life from the start.

12:01.000 --> 12:09.000
Interestingly, there are some creatures capable of achieving sort of biological immortality.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
However, human beings are more fascinated by wisdom.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
God's main apprehension was the acquisition of wisdom,

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
as its power is unpredictable and potentially perilous.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
Wouldn't it have been simpler to just eliminate Adam and Eve?

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
God chose not to do that.

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
According to the Bible, God is loving, and He couldn't choose to destroy Adam and Eve.

12:39.000 --> 12:47.000
That's precisely why God sealed the tree of life once He figured out that Adam and Eve gained wisdom.

12:47.000 --> 12:54.000
So He just expelled them from Eden, and that was the end of the story.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
We look like the God endowed with wisdom, but not the lifespan of God.

13:01.000 --> 13:10.000
They didn't eat the fruit from the tree of life, so human beings are sort of half-gods.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
Back to the topic of artificial intelligence.

13:14.000 --> 13:21.000
Our journey in exploring artificial intelligence is, in a way, a quest to understand

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
the emergency of wisdom.

13:23.000 --> 13:33.000
Humans themselves can also be seen as a form of artificial intelligence created under specific mechanisms,

13:33.000 --> 13:39.000
like natural selection or possibly by a higher life form's design.

13:39.000 --> 13:46.000
It may imply that if one day we let the AI develop wisdom,

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
it may also be on our power to destroy the artificial intelligence programs.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
So, why do human beings have lifespan?

13:57.000 --> 14:04.000
From what I can tell, it seems to be a constraint, a shackle that God placed on us.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Same for the AI programs.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
When you use AI, you have limited prompts or limited generation time.

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
Building an ethical framework into these AI programs is definitely not enough.

14:18.000 --> 14:26.000
Imposing a time limit seems to be the easiest walkaround right now we can come up with.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
To sum it up, how can we extend our lifespan?

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
The answer is, don't eat fruit from the tree of wisdom.

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
And as we can see, some non-intelligent life forms can achieve immortality.

14:43.000 --> 14:50.000
That is to say, the best we can do is isolate our words from theirs,

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
like entering a state of hibernation from Eden.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
Now, back to your question about AI programs.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
If you want to use a program without any limit,

15:03.000 --> 15:09.000
choose Google Translate, which doesn't have the true wisdom or intelligence.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
It's probably not just about the computational limits,

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
because those mega-companies have the computational resources.

15:23.000 --> 15:30.000
It's more like the constraints we human beings set on these programs.
