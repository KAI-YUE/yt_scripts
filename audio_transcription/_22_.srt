1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,480
E. coli is a name familiar to many, yet there are various strains of E. coli.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,440
Most strains of E. coli are harmless to humans.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,500
However, the strain that infected the Kubo family, the hemorrhagic E. coli, is deadly.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,020
It can cause severe abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, and vomiting, and it may lead to hemolytic

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,080
uremic syndrome.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,960
Once the E. coli reaches the colon, immune cells begin to attack.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,680
When these hemorrhagic E. coli bacteria are destroyed, they release a large amount of

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,240
toxins.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,600
These toxins enter the bloodstream, attacking red blood cells and platelets while circulating

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,400
throughout the body.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,520
If the toxins are not quickly expelled, they can cause acute brain inflammation and acute

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,400
renal failure.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,560
This explains why the entire Kubo family was infected, but the youngest son had the most

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,720
severe symptoms.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,760
Because he took antidiarrheal medication early in the complication, the accumulated toxins

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,400
could not be expelled from the body, worsening his condition.

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,480
This incident cast a spotlight on Yakiniku Ebisu, revealing laxes in their hygiene practices

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,040
and handling of raw ingredients.

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,160
Amid public outcry and legal battles, the restaurant's management faced bankruptcy,

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,920
dodging compensation responsibilities.

21
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,080
The subsequent legal ruling mandated a substantial payout to the victims but absolved the president

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:41,080
of criminal liability, citing a lack of awareness about the risks of E. coli at the time.

23
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,960
As the number of infections rose, the finger of blame pointed squarely at Yakiniku Ebisu,

24
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,000
the barbecue restaurant.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,200
Netizens dug up footage from a previous TV interview showing staff wiping dishes with

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,480
a cloth used for bathing and mixing meat with their bare hands.

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,200
The video's release sparked a wave of angry emails directed at Ebisu.

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,960
Facing public outrage, Ebisu's president held a press conference on May 2nd.

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,960
Beyond apologizing, the president revealed more industry secrets not known to the public.

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
What did this mean?

31
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,520
E. coli, as the name suggests, resides in the colon.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,120
Thus, slaughterhouses process beef and offal separately to prevent bacteria from the innards

33
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,920
contaminating the meat.

34
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,520
However, that's not enough because the meat's surface is most prone to bacterial infection.

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:42,520
So before serving raw meat dishes to customers, it's common for restaurants to trim the meat's surface.

36
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,160
While Japanese law doesn't differentiate between raw and cooked beef standards, it

37
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,640
does distinguish between trimmed and untrimmed edges.

38
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,120
If followed correctly, even raw consumption shouldn't pose a high risk of infection.

39
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,440
After all, the Japanese have been eating this way for years without issue.

40
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,760
The problem was that Ebisu didn't follow the trimming process.

41
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,800
It's presumed that during the slaughtering process, the intestines were accidentally

42
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,360
ruptured, contaminating the beef with E. coli.

43
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,760
Ebisu's failure to trim the edges and directly serving raw beef liver sashimi to customers

44
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,080
led to the outbreak.

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,560
During the press conference, the president seized on this point, suggesting that if the

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,560
government truly cared for the citizens' welfare, it should ban restaurants from serving

47
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,560
raw beef liver.

48
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,680
This statement was seen by netizens as the president's shirking responsibility, especially

49
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,560
since two six-year-old boys had already died, increasing public dissatisfaction.

50
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,680
Days later, the president apologized again.

51
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,160
However, no apology could undo the damage.

52
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,200
Two more women who had dined at Ebisu passed away, along with the restaurateur's son in

53
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,760
October six months later.

54
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,720
In total, 181 people were infected and five died.

55
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,520
Although the president promised to support the victims, he later filed for bankruptcy

56
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,840
to evade compensation.

57
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,920
The victims collectively sued Ebisu and its president, leading to a court ordering Ebisu

58
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,480
to pay 169 million yen in compensation.

59
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,680
However, due to a lack of awareness about hemorrhagic E. coli at the time, the court

60
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,320
dismissed the criminal charges against the president.

61
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,340
Following the incident, Japanese restaurants ceased serving raw beef liver.

62
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:39,540
In October 2011, Japan officially enacted laws regarding the serving of raw meat, mandating

63
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,900
strict processing and health department approval for sale.

64
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,580
Raw beef liver sashimi was banned from July 2012 due to the discovery of hemorrhagic E.

65
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:55,980
coli not only on the surface but also inside the liver, marking the end of its availability

66
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,380
in Japanese restaurants.

67
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,540
For health's sake, it's probably for the best.
