1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Today, we're going to talk about reincarnation.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,920
Just a few days ago, we discussed Penrose and the theory of quantum soul, which posits

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,200
that the state of your brain is synchronized with quantum particles somewhere in the universe.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,060
It feels like you're playing a life simulation game, and there's also a free cloud backup

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,240
on Steam.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,080
So how do we retrieve the backup?

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,820
When I woke up from a coma, I had lost all my memories.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,380
You will retrieve your memories in the distant future.

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,660
But by the time you do, you will no longer be who you are now.

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,100
It's somewhat like auto-writing a save file.

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,480
Let's start with the mathematical field of the Poincaré recurrence theorem.

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,540
In a nutshell, everything you'd experienced could potentially happen again in the future.

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:57,700
Henri Poincaré, one of France's greatest mathematicians, was also an astronomer, mathematical

14
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,380
physicist, theoretical scientist, and philosopher of science.

15
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:08,340
Poincaré is recognized as the leading mathematician of the last quarter of the 19th century and

16
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,260
the early 20th century, and the last mathematician to have a comprehensive knowledge of mathematics

17
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,100
and its applications following Gauss.

18
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,620
His outstanding work in mathematics had a profound impact on the field.

19
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:28,300
His research in celestial mechanics is another milestone after Newton, and he is also acknowledged

20
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:34,260
as a precursor to the theory of relativity for his studies on electron theory.

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,980
The Poincaré theorem, also known as Poincaré recurrence or Poincaré's return, is not

22
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:45,860
a physical law that needs verification, but a mathematical theorem.

23
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,540
The proof of Poincaré's recurrence theorem might appear brief, yet it involves a lot

24
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,580
of measure theory and set theory fundamentals.

25
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,700
Simply put, the theorem states that a dynamical system will, after a sufficient amount of

26
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,580
time, return to a state very close to its initial condition.

27
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:10,000
This may seem to contradict the thermodynamic principle of entropy increase.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,740
The former states it is impossible to return, while Poincaré said it is possible.

29
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:21,220
I'll explain more about this entropy increase principle to you all when we get the chance.

30
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,940
How long does it take for the system go back to the origin?

31
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,900
I'll hold off on answering that for now.

32
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,420
It's somewhat similar to the infinite monkey theorem in probability theory.

33
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,500
If a monkey randomly types on a typewriter for a sufficiently long time, it is almost

34
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,620
certain to type out the complete words of Shakespeare.

35
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,040
With an infinite number of monkeys, they could instantly produce all possible texts

36
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,980
that could exist in a library.

37
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,380
Of course, in reality, if you had all the monkeys in the universe typing away, after

38
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:01,020
10,000 years, they'd likely only produce a bunch of meaningless symbols.

39
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,780
Are there any other monkeys in the universe besides us?

40
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,580
I'll also hold off on answering that.

41
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:13,260
I'll explain the answer to this question and the Fermi paradox in the future.

42
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,500
Back to the Poincaré theorem.

43
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,380
Microscopically, within a system, the particles are moving in a disorderly manner and continuously

44
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:27,340
so, and there will always be a time when the particles return to their initial positions.

45
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,540
This means events will recur.

46
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:36,260
For example, at some moment in the future, our audience will re-watch our video.

47
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,940
Another simpler example.

48
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,580
If you roll two dice, the probability of getting two sixes is low.

49
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:48,620
But if you keep rolling, it will eventually happen over and over again.

50
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,880
Let's use yourself as an example.

51
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,740
The moment you are born is the starting point.

52
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,460
Your entire life unfolds.

53
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,500
At some point, conditions identical to those at the time of your birth arise again.

54
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,580
That is, the entire universe, social environment, your parents, etc.

55
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,660
And you are born again.

56
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,260
Everything must be exactly the same for it to be considered a recurrence.

57
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,820
Even a slight deviation in any condition would not count.

58
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,920
This might seem impossible to imagine.

59
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:28,060
If we add another condition, that the life of the reoccurred you is exactly the same

60
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,660
as your current life, it would mean the universe has already experienced all possible variations

61
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,580
of your life that differ from the current one.

62
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,340
There must be countless variations of your life with deviations.

63
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,060
The probability of such a recurrence would surely be nil.

64
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,860
Given enough time, nothing is impossible.

65
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,100
Perhaps God is rolling a multi-faced die to pass the time during an eternity of boredom.
