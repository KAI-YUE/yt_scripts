1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm scientist Dr. K. The girl next to me is Yuri.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm Yuri.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The AI technology is advancing nowadays. Recently, the Solar Project can automatically convert text into video.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:29,000
As a developer, I believe this is revolutionary, not only to academia, but also to the movie industry, to games, and to everything else.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes, but whether it's Tac-Bing or Sora, they all have usage time limitations. Continuous use becomes inconvenient.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's true. Speaking of which, Yuri, do you know why humans have a lifespan?

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, Dr. K, you're always bringing up deep topics.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Actually, the fundamental logic of human lifespan limit could be the same of the usage limit of AI software.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Isn't it because of computational limitations?

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Not really. Today, I will focus on the topic of human lifespan.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Maybe I will teach you how to extend the usage of the AI program, and maybe how to extend human lifespan or even achieve immortality.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There are many hypotheses in biology about human lifespan, including the most famous telomere hypothesis.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Human DNAs are like code snippets in a program or the text in a book.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Texts in a book largely determine our genders, appearance, or intelligence.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If we compel this information to books in library, then the 46 chromosomes in our body are just like 46 books.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Of course, these 46 books are paired in twos.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
In other words, the content of these books determine our appearance and intelligence.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The first and last several pages of each book are known as special blank pages. We call them telomeres.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
After copying, some of the blank pages on both ends may get contaminated.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When our body copies cells, we are actually copying these books.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
As a result, they may need to be turned out and discarded.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Eventually, there will be no blank page left, and a book with only main text cannot replicate anymore.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes, your cell cannot keep replicating itself.

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The current research has shown that the length of telomeres can accurately predict your lifespan.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
For example, the telomeres of females are longer than males.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's why statistically, females live longer than males.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
In the United States, women live on average 5 to 6 years longer than men.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So if we extend telomeres, can we extend lifespan? Does this relate to Jacked? Do they also have telomeres?

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There's no conclusive answer yet.

30
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's still not clear whether the shortening of telomeres, those blank pages, is the cause or the result of our aging.

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Of course, there are many other studies in biology.

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
For example, research has also shown that your lifespan is correlated with your level of inflammation.

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Less stress and few illness can extend your lifespan in terms of reducing the level of inflammation in your body.

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That means being with Dr. K could add 5 to 10 years to life.

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We're sad. Of course, this is just a hypothesis.

36
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
In fact, there are creatures on Earth that don't exactly follow this rule.

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And this means to a certain extent, they've achieved immortality.

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We will talk about it in later episodes.

39
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Beyond biology, today I mainly want to share with you about creationism.

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Everything's human's birth, they always have their religions.

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
For example, Bible recorded human's origin.

42
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
In the first chapter, God created everything in the world in six days and then rest for a day.

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's why we have a seven-day week.

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
God created Adam in His own image.

45
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And then He took a rib of Adam to create Eve.

46
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Pay attention. There are a lot of details here.

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And devil is in a detail.

48
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
According to Bible, God created Adam and Eve to manage His garden of Eden.

49
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Eden is a nice garden. It's close to the heaven.

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
At its center, there was a tree of wisdom of good and evil.

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Before Adam and Eve began their life in Eden,

52
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:47,000
God specifically instructed them that they could eat fruit of all trees except for the tree of wisdom.

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Adam and Eve enjoyed their life in Eden.

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
One day, a serpent alerted Eve.

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And she ate a fruit of the tree of wisdom.

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Eve also gave Adam the fruit.

57
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
They realized that the naked body is something to be embarrassed about.

58
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
God soon learned about this, and He became very anxious.

59
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So He banished them from Eden.

60
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
God also arranged angels to protect the tree of life,

61
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
preventing them from achieving eternal life.

62
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You might feel some strangeness in this story.

63
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Actually, there are many details you can dig into.

64
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
For example, first, as I said, God created Eve from Adam.

65
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And this is very similar compared to copying a template in modern computer systems.

66
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's very normal for us to create a prototype and then copy and paste.

67
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
In the Bible story, Eve was created from Adam's body,

68
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
symbolizing not just a physical connection but also sharing the same origin and attributes.

69
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
There's another intriguing detail in the story.

70
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
After Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden, God asked somebody to protect the tree of life.

71
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This raises a question naturally.

72
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Why didn't God do this from the beginning?

73
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
According to the law of attraction that has been introduced in the book Secret,

74
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
which if I got a chance, I will introduce in our later episode.

75
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So the law of attraction told us that our subconscious ignores negative words.

76
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's like when you tell yourself,

77
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
don't imagine a pink crocodile,

78
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
your mind immediately comes up with the image of a pink crocodile.

79
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So God's initial command not to eat the fruit on the tree of wisdom may encourage them to eat the fruit.

80
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's very normal for us to create a prototype and then copy and paste.

81
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
In the Bible story, Eve was created from Adam's body,

82
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
symbolizing not just a physical connection but also sharing the same origin and attributes.

83
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
There's another intriguing detail in the story.

84
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:41,000
After Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden, God asked somebody to protect the tree of life.

85
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This raises a question naturally.

86
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Why didn't God do this from the beginning?

87
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
According to the law of attraction that has been introduced in the book Secret,

88
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
which if I got a chance, I will introduce in our later episode.

89
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So the law of attraction told us that our subconscious ignores negative words.

90
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So God's initial command not to eat the fruit on the tree of wisdom may encourage them to eat the fruit.

91
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's like when you tell yourself,

92
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
don't imagine a pink crocodile,

93
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
your mind immediately comes up with the image of a pink crocodile.

94
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Actually, the tree was not only of wisdom but also of discerning good and evil.

95
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:42,000
This means that your wisdom at least is as important as your moral judgment.

96
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Why did Eve, after gaining wisdom and knowledge of good and evil,

97
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
share the fruit with her husband?

98
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And why did they hide from the God after eating the fruit?

99
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This reflects that even with wisdom and moral sense,

100
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
people's actions and words can still be inconsistent with what they believe in their hearts.

101
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is also why developing AI programs such as Chachabit to let them include ethical restrictions is very difficult.

102
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And even those engineers put so much effort into building the ethical framework in the Chachabit,

103
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
many hackers were able to jailbreak Chachabit to obtain attacking code.

104
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Huh?

105
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Let's go back to the Bible story.

106
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I would like to mention that the image of the serpent is also interesting.

107
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Why is that a serpent that tempted Eve?

108
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Snakes are reptiles similar to lizards.

109
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This may suggest that before human ancestors gained their intelligence,

110
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
the serpent were smarter or more cunning than human beings.

111
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So this story may also imply the existence and intelligence of lizard men before human ancestors.

112
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If I have a chance, I will explain all these mysteries point in future episodes.

113
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Hey, hey, how could you fall asleep?

114
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Okay, here's the thing.

115
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If you can keep awake until the end of the story and answer the final question right,

116
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,000
you can get a reward, like a gift card or cash back from our future month math findings.

117
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Huh, what I'm going to do with you, Yuri?

118
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
All right, let me answer your question.

119
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Initially, God didn't forbid eating from the tree of life.

120
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This implies He wasn't against Adam or Eve getting eternal life from the start.

121
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Interestingly, there are some creatures capable of achieving sort of biological immortality.

122
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
However, human beings are more fascinated by wisdom.

123
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
God's main apprehension was the acquisition of wisdom,

124
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
as its power is unpredictable and potentially perilous.

125
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Wouldn't it have been simpler to just eliminate Adam and Eve?

126
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
God chose not to do that.

127
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
According to the Bible, God is loving, and He couldn't choose to destroy Adam and Eve.

128
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That's precisely why God sealed the tree of life once He figured out that Adam and Eve gained wisdom.

129
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So He just expelled them from Eden, and that was the end of the story.

130
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We look like the God endowed with wisdom, but not the lifespan of God.

131
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:10,000
They didn't eat the fruit from the tree of life, so human beings are sort of half-gods.

132
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Back to the topic of artificial intelligence.

133
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Our journey in exploring artificial intelligence is, in a way, a quest to understand

134
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
the emergency of wisdom.

135
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Humans themselves can also be seen as a form of artificial intelligence created under specific mechanisms,

136
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
like natural selection or possibly by a higher life form's design.

137
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It may imply that if one day we let the AI develop wisdom,

138
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
it may also be on our power to destroy the artificial intelligence programs.

139
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So, why do human beings have lifespan?

140
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
From what I can tell, it seems to be a constraint, a shackle that God placed on us.

141
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Same for the AI programs.

142
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
When you use AI, you have limited prompts or limited generation time.

143
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Building an ethical framework into these AI programs is definitely not enough.

144
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Imposing a time limit seems to be the easiest walkaround right now we can come up with.

145
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
To sum it up, how can we extend our lifespan?

146
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The answer is, don't eat fruit from the tree of wisdom.

147
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And as we can see, some non-intelligent life forms can achieve immortality.

148
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That is to say, the best we can do is isolate our words from theirs,

149
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
like entering a state of hibernation from Eden.

150
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Now, back to your question about AI programs.

151
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If you want to use a program without any limit,

152
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
choose Google Translate, which doesn't have the true wisdom or intelligence.

153
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's probably not just about the computational limits,

154
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
because those mega-companies have the computational resources.

155
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's more like the constraints we human beings set on these programs.
