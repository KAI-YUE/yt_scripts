1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,360
That reminds me of Buddhism's cycle of reincarnation, the six realms.

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,120
Actually, there's some distinction.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,480
Since you brought it up, let's discuss Nietzsche's concept of eternal recurrence and Buddhism's

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,680
six realms.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,560
The idea of eternal recurrence suggests that our lives are an endless loop.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,600
But it's different from the six realms of Buddhism, which propose that our next life

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,760
upon death depends on whether we've done more good deeds or bad.

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,520
This determines which of the six realms we'll enter for the next cycle.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,560
In these cycles, humans can become animals, and animals can become humans.

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:56,920
The six realms include the realm of gods, humans, asuras, hungry ghosts, hell, and animals.

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,200
In this cycle, humans can turn into animals and vice versa.

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,480
But eternal recurrence isn't like that.

13
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:12,200
In eternal recurrence, you are reborn as yourself, born in the same year, with the same parents,

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,760
living exactly the same life, repeating this life infinitely.

15
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,960
Interestingly, Nietzsche, a philosopher who knew little about mathematics and physics,

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,640
proposed a viewpoint similar to this.

17
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,200
It's as if, when the scientist, after much hard work, reaches the mountaintop, he finds

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,720
the philosopher already sitting there.

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,120
Nietzsche was a renowned German philosopher and poet who introduced many profound philosophical

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,480
theories.

21
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,880
His father passed away when Nietzsche was just five, leading behind a younger brother

22
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,120
and sister.

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,520
Tragically, his brother died at the tender age of two.

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,080
Nietzsche didn't shock the world or the academic community during his lifetime.

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,640
He only gained a bit of notoriety shortly before his death.

26
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,760
Thus, he never witnessed his own success while he was alive.

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,880
Essentially, Nietzsche was a disabled man.

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,520
His vision was nearly that of a blind person, and his body was riddled with diseases from

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,480
head to toe, leading him no comfort for work or life.

30
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,800
Throughout his life, Nietzsche dedicated himself to establishing new cultures and new ideas.

31
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,920
Even at his lowest, having contemplated suicide several times, he never placed his hope in

32
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,600
divine beings.

33
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,240
Nietzsche, often misunderstood and unable to bear prolonged solitude, eventually lost

34
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,440
his sanity on the streets of Turin after embracing the neck of a horse being whipped by its owner.

35
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,040
He died of pneumonia years later.

36
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,280
Nietzsche proposed an interesting question in his work related to eternal recurrence.

37
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,200
If you were to live your life over and over again in an endless cycle, would you want to?

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,800
That means I have to go through the coma again.

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,480
In life, there will always be suffering, sadness and unhappiness.

40
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,440
Some people might be experiencing these things right now.

41
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,160
Nobody wants to endlessly repeat these experiences because that would mean infinite suffering.

42
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,440
Your life can't change, so you must change your perspective.

43
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,840
If you view all the unpleasant parts of life as necessary experiences, then there's no issue.

44
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,880
Pain comes from non-acceptance.

45
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:40,200
While external factors might treat a suffering, what truly torments you is yourself.

46
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,320
Once you liberate your mind, you'll find happiness.

47
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,520
Nietzsche's life was full of suffering.

48
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,400
Despite his predominantly painful life, he deeply loved his fate.

49
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,320
He understood that in the future, many would endure similar suffering and despair.

50
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,600
Yet, for those brief moments of happiness in life, he felt repeating life was worthwhile.
