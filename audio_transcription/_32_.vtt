00:00.001 --> 00:11.360
That reminds me of Buddhism's cycle of reincarnation, the six realms.

00:11.360 --> 00:15.120
Actually, there's some distinction.

00:15.120 --> 00:20.480
Since you brought it up, let's discuss Nietzsche's concept of eternal recurrence and Buddhism's

00:20.480 --> 00:22.680
six realms.

00:22.680 --> 00:28.560
The idea of eternal recurrence suggests that our lives are an endless loop.

00:28.560 --> 00:32.600
But it's different from the six realms of Buddhism, which propose that our next life

00:32.600 --> 00:38.760
upon death depends on whether we've done more good deeds or bad.

00:38.760 --> 00:42.520
This determines which of the six realms we'll enter for the next cycle.

00:42.520 --> 00:48.560
In these cycles, humans can become animals, and animals can become humans.

00:48.560 --> 00:56.920
The six realms include the realm of gods, humans, asuras, hungry ghosts, hell, and animals.

00:56.920 --> 01:02.200
In this cycle, humans can turn into animals and vice versa.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.480
But eternal recurrence isn't like that.

01:05.480 --> 01:12.200
In eternal recurrence, you are reborn as yourself, born in the same year, with the same parents,

01:12.200 --> 01:16.760
living exactly the same life, repeating this life infinitely.

01:16.760 --> 01:22.960
Interestingly, Nietzsche, a philosopher who knew little about mathematics and physics,

01:22.960 --> 01:25.640
proposed a viewpoint similar to this.

01:25.640 --> 01:31.200
It's as if, when the scientist, after much hard work, reaches the mountaintop, he finds

01:31.200 --> 01:34.720
the philosopher already sitting there.

01:34.720 --> 01:40.120
Nietzsche was a renowned German philosopher and poet who introduced many profound philosophical

01:40.120 --> 01:41.480
theories.

01:41.480 --> 01:45.880
His father passed away when Nietzsche was just five, leading behind a younger brother

01:45.880 --> 01:47.120
and sister.

01:47.120 --> 01:51.520
Tragically, his brother died at the tender age of two.

01:51.520 --> 01:56.080
Nietzsche didn't shock the world or the academic community during his lifetime.

01:56.080 --> 01:59.640
He only gained a bit of notoriety shortly before his death.

01:59.640 --> 02:04.760
Thus, he never witnessed his own success while he was alive.

02:04.760 --> 02:08.880
Essentially, Nietzsche was a disabled man.

02:08.880 --> 02:13.520
His vision was nearly that of a blind person, and his body was riddled with diseases from

02:13.520 --> 02:19.480
head to toe, leading him no comfort for work or life.

02:19.680 --> 02:25.800
Throughout his life, Nietzsche dedicated himself to establishing new cultures and new ideas.

02:25.800 --> 02:30.920
Even at his lowest, having contemplated suicide several times, he never placed his hope in

02:30.920 --> 02:32.600
divine beings.

02:32.600 --> 02:38.240
Nietzsche, often misunderstood and unable to bear prolonged solitude, eventually lost

02:38.240 --> 02:44.440
his sanity on the streets of Turin after embracing the neck of a horse being whipped by its owner.

02:44.440 --> 02:48.040
He died of pneumonia years later.

02:48.080 --> 02:53.280
Nietzsche proposed an interesting question in his work related to eternal recurrence.

02:53.280 --> 02:59.200
If you were to live your life over and over again in an endless cycle, would you want to?

02:59.200 --> 03:04.800
That means I have to go through the coma again.

03:04.800 --> 03:09.480
In life, there will always be suffering, sadness and unhappiness.

03:09.480 --> 03:13.440
Some people might be experiencing these things right now.

03:13.440 --> 03:20.160
Nobody wants to endlessly repeat these experiences because that would mean infinite suffering.

03:20.160 --> 03:24.440
Your life can't change, so you must change your perspective.

03:24.440 --> 03:30.840
If you view all the unpleasant parts of life as necessary experiences, then there's no issue.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.880
Pain comes from non-acceptance.

03:33.880 --> 03:40.200
While external factors might treat a suffering, what truly torments you is yourself.

03:40.240 --> 03:43.320
Once you liberate your mind, you'll find happiness.

03:43.320 --> 03:47.520
Nietzsche's life was full of suffering.

03:47.520 --> 03:52.400
Despite his predominantly painful life, he deeply loved his fate.

03:52.400 --> 03:57.320
He understood that in the future, many would endure similar suffering and despair.

03:57.320 --> 04:02.600
Yet, for those brief moments of happiness in life, he felt repeating life was worthwhile.
