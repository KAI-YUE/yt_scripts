00:00.001 --> 00:04.880
Today, we're going to talk about reincarnation.

00:04.880 --> 00:09.920
Just a few days ago, we discussed Penrose and the theory of quantum soul, which posits

00:09.920 --> 00:15.200
that the state of your brain is synchronized with quantum particles somewhere in the universe.

00:15.200 --> 00:19.060
It feels like you're playing a life simulation game, and there's also a free cloud backup

00:19.060 --> 00:21.240
on Steam.

00:21.240 --> 00:24.080
So how do we retrieve the backup?

00:24.080 --> 00:28.820
When I woke up from a coma, I had lost all my memories.

00:28.820 --> 00:32.380
You will retrieve your memories in the distant future.

00:32.380 --> 00:37.660
But by the time you do, you will no longer be who you are now.

00:37.660 --> 00:42.100
It's somewhat like auto-writing a save file.

00:42.100 --> 00:46.480
Let's start with the mathematical field of the Poincaré recurrence theorem.

00:46.480 --> 00:51.540
In a nutshell, everything you'd experienced could potentially happen again in the future.

00:51.540 --> 00:57.700
Henri Poincaré, one of France's greatest mathematicians, was also an astronomer, mathematical

00:57.700 --> 01:02.380
physicist, theoretical scientist, and philosopher of science.

01:02.380 --> 01:08.340
Poincaré is recognized as the leading mathematician of the last quarter of the 19th century and

01:08.340 --> 01:14.260
the early 20th century, and the last mathematician to have a comprehensive knowledge of mathematics

01:14.260 --> 01:18.100
and its applications following Gauss.

01:18.100 --> 01:22.620
His outstanding work in mathematics had a profound impact on the field.

01:22.620 --> 01:28.300
His research in celestial mechanics is another milestone after Newton, and he is also acknowledged

01:28.300 --> 01:34.260
as a precursor to the theory of relativity for his studies on electron theory.

01:34.260 --> 01:39.980
The Poincaré theorem, also known as Poincaré recurrence or Poincaré's return, is not

01:39.980 --> 01:45.860
a physical law that needs verification, but a mathematical theorem.

01:45.860 --> 01:50.540
The proof of Poincaré's recurrence theorem might appear brief, yet it involves a lot

01:50.540 --> 01:54.580
of measure theory and set theory fundamentals.

01:54.580 --> 01:59.700
Simply put, the theorem states that a dynamical system will, after a sufficient amount of

01:59.700 --> 02:04.580
time, return to a state very close to its initial condition.

02:04.580 --> 02:10.000
This may seem to contradict the thermodynamic principle of entropy increase.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.740
The former states it is impossible to return, while Poincaré said it is possible.

02:15.740 --> 02:21.220
I'll explain more about this entropy increase principle to you all when we get the chance.

02:21.220 --> 02:25.940
How long does it take for the system go back to the origin?

02:25.940 --> 02:28.900
I'll hold off on answering that for now.

02:28.900 --> 02:33.420
It's somewhat similar to the infinite monkey theorem in probability theory.

02:33.420 --> 02:38.500
If a monkey randomly types on a typewriter for a sufficiently long time, it is almost

02:38.500 --> 02:43.620
certain to type out the complete words of Shakespeare.

02:43.620 --> 02:48.040
With an infinite number of monkeys, they could instantly produce all possible texts

02:48.040 --> 02:50.980
that could exist in a library.

02:50.980 --> 02:55.380
Of course, in reality, if you had all the monkeys in the universe typing away, after

02:55.380 --> 03:01.020
10,000 years, they'd likely only produce a bunch of meaningless symbols.

03:01.020 --> 03:04.780
Are there any other monkeys in the universe besides us?

03:04.780 --> 03:07.580
I'll also hold off on answering that.

03:07.580 --> 03:13.260
I'll explain the answer to this question and the Fermi paradox in the future.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.500
Back to the Poincaré theorem.

03:15.500 --> 03:21.380
Microscopically, within a system, the particles are moving in a disorderly manner and continuously

03:21.380 --> 03:27.340
so, and there will always be a time when the particles return to their initial positions.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.540
This means events will recur.

03:29.540 --> 03:36.260
For example, at some moment in the future, our audience will re-watch our video.

03:36.260 --> 03:37.940
Another simpler example.

03:37.940 --> 03:42.580
If you roll two dice, the probability of getting two sixes is low.

03:42.580 --> 03:48.620
But if you keep rolling, it will eventually happen over and over again.

03:48.620 --> 03:51.880
Let's use yourself as an example.

03:51.880 --> 03:54.740
The moment you are born is the starting point.

03:54.740 --> 03:57.460
Your entire life unfolds.

03:57.460 --> 04:02.500
At some point, conditions identical to those at the time of your birth arise again.

04:02.500 --> 04:07.580
That is, the entire universe, social environment, your parents, etc.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.660
And you are born again.

04:09.660 --> 04:15.260
Everything must be exactly the same for it to be considered a recurrence.

04:15.260 --> 04:19.820
Even a slight deviation in any condition would not count.

04:19.820 --> 04:22.920
This might seem impossible to imagine.

04:22.920 --> 04:28.060
If we add another condition, that the life of the reoccurred you is exactly the same

04:28.060 --> 04:33.660
as your current life, it would mean the universe has already experienced all possible variations

04:33.660 --> 04:38.580
of your life that differ from the current one.

04:38.580 --> 04:42.340
There must be countless variations of your life with deviations.

04:42.340 --> 04:46.060
The probability of such a recurrence would surely be nil.

04:46.060 --> 04:48.860
Given enough time, nothing is impossible.

04:48.860 --> 04:54.100
Perhaps God is rolling a multi-faced die to pass the time during an eternity of boredom.
